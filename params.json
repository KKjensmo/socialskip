The SocialSkip system employs a custom web-video player and a web-database to keep a record of basic user actions (play, pause, and skip).\r\n\r\nSocialSkip is also integrated with Google Drive, which allows the addition of a questionnaire next to the video. This feature has been useful in video experiments for learning, which include quiz questions next to the video.\r\n\r\nThe main feature of SocialSkip is a video browser with custom player buttons that collects user interactions with the video to a data-base.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis web app integrates the following technologies and tools:\r\n\r\n* Google App Engine\r\n* AppEngine Java SDK\r\n* Java Servlets and Java Server Pages\r\n* JQuery\r\n* JQuery Mobile\r\n* HTML5 Canvas\r\n* Youtube IFrame player API\r\n* Google Charts\r\n* Google Fusion Tables\r\n* Datastore API\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n* Java JDK 1.7 - [Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) and [Install](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/index.html)\r\n* Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers - [Download](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)\r\n* Google Plugin for Eclipse - [Install](https://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/download)\r\n* EGit - [Install](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/)\r\n* Google account - Don't have?
